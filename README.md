## Toronto Parking Ticket Data Capstone

**Dataset**: This dataset, available on Open Toronto's website, contains information about parking tickets issued in the city of Toronto from 2012 to 2022. It includes details such as the ticket issuance date, location, violation type, and fine amount. With approximately 2 million rows of data per year, this dataset provides a comprehensive record of parking violations in Toronto over a ten-year period.

### **Project Overview**: 
My interest is focused on analyzing parking tickets in the city of Toronto, which falls under the broader field of urban data analysis. 

### **Problem Area**

Fairness and Equity - Analyzing ticket distribution across different neighborhoods is essential to uncover any disparities in enforcement practices.
1. By mapping the distribution of parking tickets across various neighborhoods in Toronto, I plan to visually identify any disproportionate enforcement in certain areas. This analysis may reveal whether tickets are issued more frequently in lower-income neighborhoods or areas with higher proportions of certain demographic groups.
2. Conducting statistical tests can help find disparities in ticket issuance. For example, I could compare the average number of tickets issued per capita in different neighborhoods and determine if there are statistically significant differences.

Resource Allocation - Understanding where and when parking violations occur most frequently is crucial for optimizing resource allocation for enforcement laws and efforts.

1. Analyze any patterns of parking violations to identify peak times and days of the week when violations are most shown. This analysis can help the city schedule enforcement patrols more efficiently, finding when and where they are most needed.
2. Using mapping analysis to identify hotspots of parking violations within the city. Pinpointing areas with high concentrations of violations, the city can prioritize enforcement efforts in these locations to maximize effectiveness.
3. Developing predictive models based on historical data to forecast future parking violation hotspots. By leveraging factors such as time of day, day of the week, events, and other relevant variables, these models can help the city proactively allocate resources and plan enforcement strategies.

### **Users**

Residents 
- Residents in different neighborhoods may experience discrepancy in parking enforcement, with some areas facing more frequent ticketing than others. This could lead to feelings of unfair
treatment, mostly if enforcement practices appear biased or inequitable. Residents across all neighborhoods stand to benefit from a more transparent and fair parking enforcement system.

Communities affected by unequal enforcement 
- Communities that often get hit harder with parking tickets would endure more fines. Hence
more financial stress from piling up tickets, making it tougher to afford other things. Plus, increased enforcement could make it trickier for residents in these areas to get to important places like work or the grocery store.
